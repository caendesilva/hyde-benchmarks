# HydePHP - Benchmarks (Stress test branch)

See the main branch for setup. This branch experiments with pushing the limits of how many pages can be generated.

## Dataset size

Lorem ipsum lines were increased from 100 to 1000. Only page type is Markdown page. Page count is variable.

Benchmark is performed by running `php hyde build` twice and using the result of the second run.

## Results

### Analysis

As can be seen, the time per page increases with the number of pages. It is interesting that the increase factor is factor 10,
which is the same as the increase in the number of pages. This suggests that as the workload increases, the efficiency decreases.

All in all, this is more than acceptable results, as this is truly a massive amount of data.
